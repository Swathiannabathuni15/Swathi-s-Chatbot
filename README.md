ðŸ”Š Voice Output Feature (Streamlit Chatbot)
This Streamlit-based chatbot includes an integrated voice output feature that enhances user interaction by converting text responses into speech. Instead of using pyttsx3â€”which may conflict with Streamlitâ€™s event loopâ€”the application uses gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to generate speech from text. The audio is saved as an MP3 file and played in-browser using st.audio, ensuring smooth, asynchronous operation. This approach makes the chatbot more accessible, especially for users with visual impairments or reading difficulties, and adds a dynamic, user-friendly layer to the interface.

This is an interactive AI-powered **portfolio chatbot** that presents the resume of *Annabathuni Swathi*, a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Built using **Streamlit**, it allows users to ask questions about her skills, education, projects, internships, and more. The chatbot responds with accurate details extracted from her resume and includes a **voice assistant** feature using `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech. It's designed to showcase Swathiâ€™s profile in an engaging and conversational way, ideal for recruiters and professionals exploring her qualifications and achievements.
